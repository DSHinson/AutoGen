# AutoGenDemo

## Overview

AutoGenDemo is a project designed to demonstrate automatic code generation techniques in a .NET environment. The project comprises multiple components that work together to showcase how attributes and code generation can streamline development processes.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several key components:

1. **Generator**: This is the core library responsible for creating the code at compile time using an IncrementalGenerator.
    - **Files**:
        - `GenService.cs`: Contains the compile time logic to create source code.
    - **Folders**:
        - `Templates`: Contains the template .txt files that will be the base of the generated code.

2. **Generator.Attributes**: contains the attributes that will determine the type of autogenerated functionality
    - **Files**:
        - Classes that contain one class attribute each.

3. **TesterConsole**: A console application to test and demonstrate the functionality of the generated code.
    - **Files**:
        - `Program.cs`: Entry point of the console application.
        - `TesterConsole.csproj`: Project file for the console application.
4. **TestAutoGen.Api**: An empty APi project that when compiled will reference the output of the GenService for controllers
5. **TestAutoGen.Dal**: The base database access functionality.
    - **Files**:
        - `DalBase.cs` : The base db access functioanlity
    - **Folders**:
        - `models for auto gen` : contains all the models with their attributes to be generated

## Getting Started

To get started with the AutoGenDemo project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 8.0 or later
- A code editor or IDE such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DSHinson/AutoGen.git
    cd AutoGenDemo
    ```

2. **Restore dependencies**:
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

3. **Build the solution**:
    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

### Running the Project

1. **Navigate to the TestAuoGen.Api project**:
    ```bash
    cd TestAuoGen.Api
    ```

2. **Run the console application**:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

This will execute the console application, demonstrating the functionality of the generated code.

## Usage

The project demonstrates how to use custom attributes to generate boilerplate code automatically. By defining attributes in the `Generator.Attributes` library and applying them in the `TestAutoGen.Dal` project, the necessary code is generated and executed in the `TestAuoGen.Api` application.
